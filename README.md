cleanGCode
==========

Dead simple python script for removing comments and blanks from GCode files. Doesn't do anything else.

Use Python 2.7. Python 3 apparently gives a syntax error.

ATTRIBUTIONS:
--------
Sampled regex code from preGRBL by chamnit (https://github.com/chamnit). 
Sampled argv code from online tutorial.
There isn't much that wasn't just copypasta, but it works.
